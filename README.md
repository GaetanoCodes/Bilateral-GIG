The code allows to calibrate the BGIG distribution introduced in [*The bilateral generalized inverse Gaussian process with applications to financial modeling*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10557) by Gaetano AGAZZOTTI and Jean-Philippe AGUILAR. The calibration is achieved with a moment-based method.

Calibration is done on SP500 index from 2021 to 2023.


## Installation

A script is available for an easy creation of the conda environment and compilation of auxiliary functions:
```bash
$ source install.bash
```

## How to use ? 

A toy example can be ran with:

```bash
$ python main.py
```

## Results

Here is an example of simulated BGIG trajectories.

The main application is the calibration to SP500 index (see figure below).
